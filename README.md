My project is called D2 in the Summer, which is a movie that follows Fatima and her journey involving D2. I used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create a website showcasing the shortfilm. 
This site has three pages, which can be discovered by scrolling or clicking the buttons at the top navigation bar. 
The first pages showcases the movie poster, which includes the title, and a description of the movie's events. The second page shows four clips from the movie that begin playing when the mouse hovers over them, and the last page shows a descriptions of the creators and their vision.
I wanted the theme of the website to be calming, which is why I chose pastel colors. I was striving to create a positive and easy-to-navigate experience for the viewer, and so I made the website have a simple and clean look.
I chose a color scheme and stuck to three simple colors, and I tried to make all the elements fit on the website harmoniously. I used HTML to implement all the elements such as photos, videos and texts. Then I used JavaScript to add an element of interaction by allowing the user to play and stop the videos. Lastly, I used CSS to design all the elements of the website
I was pleased that I met my goals from the wireframe, and implemented all the elements I wanted to. I did not expect the roadbloacks I had when trying to figure out JavaScript. I am pleased with the final result, but I want to keep working on the website to perfect it more.
