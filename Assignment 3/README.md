Our project is titled “Journey Through the Forest”, and it is a website that depicts a title screen, three forest scenes at different times of day, and an ending scene. The website is meant to be an immersive experience that allows the user to feels as though they are walking down a forest path from day to night. All screens have a play, pause, and volume higher and lower button, as we wanted the user to control the audio. Additionally, the central button on all the screens takes the user through the journey, allowing them to go through the website at their own pace. To increase the viewer’s immersion experience, we had the images slowly zoom in, creating the affect of forward movement. The first screen is of the entry gate into the forest, and there is thematic music playing in the background. The user chooses when to start the audio by pressing the play button. For the rest of the screens, the audio automatically plays, with audio that matches the images and the time of day that is depicted. After going on a journey from morning to afternoon to night, the user can press end journey, which leads them to the last screen that shows an exit in the forest. Then, the user is able to restart the journey. 

We implemented this process by dividing up the pieces of the project. The sound piece draws inspiration from different audio elements to create a rich and dynamic storytelling experience. It incorporates natural sounds and site-specific recordings using an NTG-2 microphone and a Zoom H5n recorder intertwined in Audacity to evoke a sense of presence and exploration. By combining these elements, the piece guides listeners through a journey with a distinct beginning, middle, and end, offering a cohesive and engaging narrative structure. Three of the group members worked on each audio piece for the morning, afternoon, and night. 

The website was coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. One group member worked mainly on the webiste layout, and then we all collaborated on features of the website such as the zoom feature, volume control, and other buttons. This project greatly met my expectations and goals as I am very pleased with the finally result. We envisioned a similar look to the website, and we believe my group collaborated well together to create an aesthetic and auditory pleasing website. We think our website tells a clear story of a person wandering through a serene and lush forest. If we had more time, we would want to improve the audios' by incorporating more sounds and making it more complex, as well as create longer audios as the audios we created were only around a minute long.
